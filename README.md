This script will:
1. Detect your OS and architecture.
2. Download the appropriate binary from the latest GitHub release.
3. Make it executable.
4. Attempt to install it into a directory in your PATH (e.g., $HOME/.local/bin, /usr/local/bin). It will ask for sudo if needed for system-wide directories.

## üöÄ Usage

qik uses your configured editor (default: nvim) to open a temporary file where you can type or paste your text. After you save and close the editor, qik processes the text.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

qik looks for a configuration file in the following order:

1. Path specified by the --config flag.
2. $HOME/.config/qik/config.yaml (on Linux/macOS) or platform equivalent.
3. ./config.yaml (in the current directory).

If no config file is found, qik will attempt to create a default one at $HOME/.config/qik/config.yaml.

You can customize:
* defaultLanguage: e.g., "Norwegian", "English"
* editor: e.g., "nvim", "vim", "nano", "code --wait"
* geminiModel: e.g., "gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
* defaultMood: e.g., "neutral", "professional"
* prompts: Customize the instructions given to the AI for fix, explain, and answer tasks.
* moods: Define custom moods with their descriptions and AI instructions.

See the config.example.yaml in this repository for a full example and all available options.

**API Key:**
It is **highly recommended** to set your Gemini API key using:

1. The pass password manager: pass insert gemini_api_key
2. An environment variable: export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

You can also set geminiApiKey in the config file, but this is less secure.
